    " - `focus_collection` _[required]_ : the name of the Zotero collection where all the user's papers of interest are available for ReadNext.\n",
    " - `proposals_collection` _[default: \"\"]_ : the name of the Zotero collection where the papers proposed by ReadNext will be added.\n",
    " - `with_artifacts` _[default: False]_ : if set to `True`, the artifacts related to the proposed papers (PDF & summary files) will be added to Zotero.\n",
    " - `nb_proposals` _[default: 10]_ : the number of papers that will be proposed by ReadNext.\n",

    " - `zotero_collection` _[required]_ : the name of the Zotero collection where your papers of interest are stored in Zotero. This is what we refer to as the \"Focus\" collection above. The name of the collection is case sensitive and should be exactly as written in Zotero.\n",

If you don't use this option, ReadNext will only print the proposed papers in the terminal, but will not save them in Zotero. The default behaviour is that you don't save them in Zotero.\n",
    " - `--with-artifacts` / `-a` _[default: False]_ : which tells ReadNext that you want to save the artifacts (PDF file of the papers and their summarization) into Zotero. This is the recommended workflow, but it requires a lot more space in your Zotero account. If you want to do this, you will most likely need to subscribe to one of their paid option.\n",
    " - `--nb-proposals` _[default: 10]_ : which tells ReadNext how many papers you want to be proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following command will propose 3 papers from the `cs.AI` caterory, based on the `Readnext-Focus-LLM` collection in my Zotero library, save them in Zotero in the `Readnext-Propositions-LLM` with all related artifacts:\n",
